Someone a few feet away threatening to harm or kill you at any moment is assault. Intimidation is less severe as there’s a distance that someone can escape through, or that the perpetrator has more time to reconsider the threat.

Its range in imprisonment is intended to account for when such severe harm is premeditated or accidental.For accidents and negligence there must be evidence of foul play, criminality in the instance, or some other factor beyond a truly accidental incident. For example, injuring someone while speeding or intoxicated.\n\n((Aggravated Battery is much less severe and would not, for example, leave someone in a coma or brutally wounded script-wise.

An opportunity to reflect (and therefore possibly change your mind) demonstrates premeditation and is murder. Manslaughter is only charged in the penal code when some sort of criminal negligence or action can be proven. Killing someone while driving drunk is manslaughter.
